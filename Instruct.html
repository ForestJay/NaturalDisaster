<p>Natural Disaster is a one to six player turn based strategy
game.&nbsp; The game is a competetion for points.&nbsp; As a
single player game the points can be used to compare against
previous scores.&nbsp; With multiple players the game is a battle
for the most points. </p>

<p>All of the players are the presidents of local building
companies. To earn points you must build structures, win <a
href="#Contract Screen">contracts</a>, and with multiple players
compete for land.&nbsp; To build structures you need to use
resources.&nbsp; You accumulate resources at the beginning of
yourr turn.&nbsp; Some structures are worth more points but they
also cost more resources.&nbsp; There is a tech tree that causes
only one building type to be useable in the beginning of the
game.&nbsp; You can sell structures to other players for points
and/or resources. </p>

<p>There is a limited amount of land for you to build on.&nbsp;
The game ends when all of the empty land has been built on. <a
href="#Contract Screen">Contracts</a> all have different
requirements, like structures needed to fill the contract must
all be adjacent to each other.&nbsp; Once you have built a
structure you can <a href="#Sell Screen">sell</a> it to another
player, <a href="#Trade Screen">trade</a> it, demolish it, or use
it to fulfill a <a href="#Contract Screen">contract</a>.&nbsp;
You do not own properties if they have been used to fulfill
contracts. You cannot sell or trade structures that you have used
to fulfill a contract.&nbsp; You can demolish a structure that
you own at twice the point cost of the original structure.&nbsp;
Once you have demolished a structure you can build a new
structure on the land.&nbsp; If the player does not build a new
structure the land will be useable by other players. </p>

<p>The game will <a href="#Credits/End Game Screen">end</a> when
all of the available land has been built on.&nbsp; You will only
be able to build on land that is adjacent to a road.&nbsp; Roads
and bridges cannot be destroyed.&nbsp; You can build roads for a
small amount of resources.&nbsp; All roads must be connected. No
points are accumulated from building roads or bridges. Some
rivers can have bridges built over them. Bridges must be attached
to roads. </p>

<p>The resource a player gets during his or her turn will be
determined at random. Sometimes instead of getting a resource a
natural disaster will occur. The natural disaster will cause one
of several things to happen, like a loss of resources or the
destruction of an existing building. </p>

<p><a name="Game Flow:"></a><font size="5">Game Flow:</font> </p>

<p>The game will <a href="#Setup Screen">start</a> by prompting
for the number of players. Each player will then be asked to <a
href="#Player Name Entry Screen">enter their name</a>. After all
the names have been entered the game will begin. Each player will
take a turn in the order that the players entered their names. </p>

<p>The <a href="#Setup Screen">map size</a> will be determined by
the players. The map or playing field will be <a
href="#Random Map Generation">randomly generated</a>. Most of the
land will be buildable and one road will be in the map. The map
may also have up to five rivers. </p>

<p>When a your turn starts you will be given either two units of
a random resource or a natural disaster will occur. The resources
are wood, steel, concrete, glass, and gold. Gold can be used to
buy any of the other four resources and works essentially as a
&quot;wild-card&quot; resource. A natural disaster can cause the
loss or addition of resources, the destruction of structure(s),
and limit a players turn. </p>

<p>After you receive the resource your score, and resource counts
will be <a href="#Main Game Screen">displayed</a>. Your turn
last's until you choose to end the turn. You can build, <a
href="#Sell Screen">sell</a>, <a href="#Trade Screen">trade</a>,
bid for a <a href="#Contract Screen">contract</a>, and demolish
buildings during your turn. You can only build a structure if you
have the resources and meet the requirements. </p>

<p>You can sell a structure to any other player. Roads and
bridges are not owned by players. The buyer will be asked whether
they want to buy the offered property. If they decline, the
seller can make an offer to another player. The buyer gets no
points with the purchase. The seller will not lose the points he
or she earned for building the structure. The seller can ask for
any amount of points and or resources that the buyer has. </p>

<p>You can trade any structure or structures with any other
player's structure(s). The tradee must agree to the trade. Trades
only effect ownership, they do not effect points or resources. A
structure used to fulfill a contract can not be traded. </p>

<p>There are always three available contracts. You will win any
contract you bid for if you meet the contract's requirement. Once
a bid is won the you will no longer own the property. When a bid
is won the contract is replaced by a new contract. When you
demolish a structure you lose twice the point value of the
structure. </p>

<p>When you build the map will be checked to see if any land is
still available to be built on. If there is no land left, the
game will end. The player with the most points will be declared a
winner. If there is a tie the winner will be determined based on
the number of resources they have. </p>
