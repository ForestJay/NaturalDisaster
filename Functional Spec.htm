<p>Natural Disaster is going to be a one to six player turn based
strategy game.&nbsp; The game will be a competetion for points.&nbsp;
As a single player game the points can be used to compare against
previous scores.&nbsp; With multiple players the game is a battle
for the most points. </p>

<p>All of the players are the presidents of local building
companies. To earn points the players must build structures, win <a
href="#Contract Screen">contracts</a>, and with multiple players
compete for land.&nbsp; To <a href="#Build Screen">build</a>
structures the players need to use resources.&nbsp; Players
accumulate resources at the beginning of their turn.&nbsp; Some
structures are worth more points but they also cost more
resources.&nbsp; There is a tech tree that causes only one
building type to be useable in the beginning of the game.&nbsp;
Players can sell structures to other players for points and/or
resources. </p>

<p>There is a limited amount of land for the players to build on.&nbsp;
<a href="#Contract Screen">Contracts</a> all have different
requirements like structures needed to fill the contract must all
be adjacent to each other.&nbsp; Once a player has <a
href="#Build Screen">built</a> a structure (s)he can <a
href="#Sell Screen">sell</a> it to another player, <a
href="#Trade Screen">trade</a> it, demolish it, or use it to
fulfill a <a href="#Contract Screen">contract</a>.&nbsp; A player
does not own properties they built and used to fulfill contracts.
Players cannot sell or trade structures that they have used to
fulfill a contract.&nbsp; A player can demolish a structure that
they own at twice the point cost of the original structure.&nbsp;
Once a player has demolished a structure (s)he can build a new
structure on the land.&nbsp; If the player does not build a new
structure the land will be useable by other players. </p>

<p>The game will <a href="#Credits/End Game Screen">end</a> when
all of the available land has been built on.&nbsp; Players will
only be able to build on land that is adjacent to a <a
href="#Road Tiles:">road</a>.&nbsp; Roads and <a
href="#Bridge Tiles:">bridges</a> cannot be destroyed.&nbsp; All
players can build roads for a small amount of resources.&nbsp;
All roads must be connected. No points are accumulated from
building roads. Rivers can have bridges built over them. Bridges
must be built over water to connect two existing roads. </p>

<p>The resource a player gets during his or her turn will be
determined at random. Sometimes instead of getting a resource a
natural disaster will occur. The natural disaster will cause one
of several things to happen like a loss of resources or the
destruction of an existing building. </p>

<p><a name="Game Flow:"></a><font size="5">Game Flow:</font> </p>

<p>The game will <a href="#Setup Screen">start</a> by prompting
for the number of players. Each player will then be asked to <a
href="#Player Name Entry Screen">enter their name</a>. After all
the names have been entered the game will begin. Each player will
take a turn in the order that the players entered their names. </p>

<p>The <a href="#Setup Screen">map size</a> will be determined by
the players. The map or playing field will be <a
href="#Random Map Generation">randomly generated</a>. Most of the
land will be buildable but at least one <a href="#Road Tiles:">road</a>
will be in the map. The map will also have at least one river. </p>

<p>When a player's turn starts they will be given either two
units of a random resource or a natural disaster will occur. The
resources are wood, steel, concrete, glass, and gold. Gold can be
used to buy any of the other four resources and works essentially
as a &quot;wild-card&quot; resource. A natural disaster can cause
the loss or addition of resources, the destruction of structure(s).
</p>

<p>After the player receives the resource their score, and
resource counts will be <a href="#Main Game Screen">displayed</a>.
The player's turn last's until (s)he chooses to end the turn. A
player can <a href="#Build Screen">build</a>, <a
href="#Sell Screen">sell</a>, <a href="#Trade Screen">trade</a>,
bid for a <a href="#Contract Screen">contract</a>, and demolish
buildings during their turn. A player can only build a structure
if they have the resources and meet the requirements. </p>

<p>A player can sell a structure to any other player. Roads and
bridges are not owned by players. The buyer will be asked whether
they want to buy the offered property. If they decline, the
seller can make an offer to another player. The buyer gets no
points with the purchase. The seller will not lose the points he
or she earned for building the structure. The seller can ask for
any amount of points and or resources. </p>

<p>A player can trade any structure or structures with any other
player's structure(s). The tradee must agree to the trade. Trades
only effect ownership, they do not effect points or resources. A
structure used to fulfill a contract can not be traded. </p>

<p>There are always three available contracts. A player will win
any contract they bid for if they meet the contract's requirement.
Once a bid is won the player will no longer own the property.
When a bid is won the contract is replaced by a new contract.
When a player demolishes a structure they lose twice the point
value of the structure. </p>

<p>When a player ends their turn the map will be checked to see
if any land is still available to be built on. If there is no
land left, the game will end. The player with the most points
will be declared a winner. If there is a tie the winner will be
determined based on the number of resources they have. </p>

Tiles:</font> </p>

<p><font color="#000000" size="3">The structures Tiles are very
important. All of a players structures must be easily
identifiable as owned by that player. There are three obvious
ways to do this, the first is to have all of a player's
structures be a certain color. If we go with a color scheme we
must be careful that this won't pose a problem to color-blind
players. The second way is to have different styles, say one
player's structures has a South-West theme and another player's
has a roman theme. The last choose would be to mix the two ideas
by using themes and colors. This will be up to the Lead Artist to
decide.</font> </p>
